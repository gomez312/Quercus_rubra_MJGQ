This repositopry contains the data files for the manuscript submitted to Molecular Ecology titled: Genetic differentiation across a steep and narrow environmental gradient: Quantitative genetic and genomic insights into Lake Superior populations of *Quercus rubra*. 
The files contain:

1. Metadata for sampled populations
2. Raw RAD-Seq data
3. Fileted and unfiltered SNP
4. Common garden trait measumeremnts,
5. Environmental variables for each population

This data share was prepared by Maria Jose Gomez Quijano, Briana L. Gross and Julie R. Etterson using Federal funds under award NA17NOS4190062 from the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, administered by the Office for Coastal Management, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce provided to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for Minnesota's Lake Superior Coastal Program. The statements, findings, conclusions, and recommendations are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA's Office of Coastal Management, the U.S. Department of Commerce, or the Minnesota DNR.
