This repositopry contains the data files for the manuscript submitted to Molecular Ecology titled: Genetic differentiation across a steep and narrow environmental gradient: Quantitative genetic and genomic insights into Lake Superior populations of *Quercus rubra*. 
The files contain:

1. Metadata for sampled populations
2. Raw RAD-Seq data
3. Fileted and unfiltered SNP
4. Common garden trait measumeremnts,
5. Environmental variables for each population
