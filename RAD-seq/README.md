## Data files and column descriptions:

All the files in the DRUM repository (https://doi.org/10.13020/dqet-h494) containing `Gross2_Project_012_*`  are part of one big data set that was analyzed all together within this files the raw reads can be found as well as the collection information for each sample. Data has been seperated by "region" due to file size.

The geospatial data provided, contains information from the collection sites for every sample in the `Gross2_Project_012_*`  dataset. Populations were identified using the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources releve data. Coastal populations were located between 0-16 kmn from the coast of Lake Superior, inland populations were located between 17-80 km from the shore, and interior populations between 81-160 km from the shore of Lake Superior.
