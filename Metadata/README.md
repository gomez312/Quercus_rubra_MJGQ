## Data files and column descriptions:

1. `Geospatial_data_Oak_project.csv` --> This dataset contains the geospatial location of each of the 33 populations that were collected. All of the samples are within the state of Minnesota. In the dataset each entry refers to one population. 

2. `Sequencing_Individual_Information.csv` --> This data is the sample information for the individuals in the `Quercus_rubra_MJGQ/VCF/` directory and on the Raw sequencing data in the NCBI: BioProject: PRJNA1131843


### column descriptions:

1. `Geospatial_data_Oak_project.csv` --> For each population there is the following information: species name, MNDNR releve site number, name of the collection site, population name, region name, latitude and longitude. Populations were identified using the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources releve data. Coastal populations were located between 0-16 km from the coast of Lake Superior, inland populations were located between 17-80 km from the shore, and interior populations between 81-160 km from the shore of Lake Superior.

2. `Sequencing_Individual_Information.csv` --> the dataset contains the sample name, the raw number of reads generated after Illumina sequencing, the species name, the region where the data was collected, and the two letter population code each sample belongs to.
